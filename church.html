                        <p class="contentDesc">Christian faith is foundational to Silliman education. Various activities for faith nurture, education, worship, fellowship, and service are in store for Silliman students all year round. These are activities that are receptive to the changing needs and preferences of students. Church activities are designed and organized in a way that does not discriminate students from other religious denominations.</p>

                                    Last August 19, I went to the CSS Opening Devotion. This event was hosted by the College of Computer Studies and was required for all CCS Students. This was also my first time inside the Silliman Church.
                                    <br><br>
	                                The scripture readings for this devotion was found in Ephesians 3:20. The message of the speaker talked about personal shield being our strengths, values and beliefs and to me it was very important because I really understood that we have to recognize that these are the things that will carry us in challenging times.
                                    <br><br>
	                                This activity set my views on Silliman’s religious activities as this is my first time attending a religious activity in this School. As someone from a different denomination (Seventh-Day Adventist), I was surprised by how similar our service style and the teachings are. I don’t plan on continuing on engaging on religious activities in Silliman, but I’d still be open to joining events that resonates with my beliefs.
                                    <br><br>
	                                Because of this event, I am more open to understanding different opinions and expressions of their own personal faith. This event has also reminded me to stay grounded with my faith and respect others beliefs.

                                    Last August 26, I attended the Unity Service held at the Amphitheatre. This service was headed by the Silliman Church and this was supposed to be for the founders week right before the Parada Sillimaniana starts.
                                    <br><br>
	                                I never expected to join this service because I was only planning to join the Parada, but participating in this event was still worth my time. The message was centered around 1st Samuel 1 Samuel 17:20-50, which is the story about David and Goliath. The message was short but it still served as a powerful reminder that we should be trusting God all the time despite facing our own challenges.
                                    <br><br>
	                                The story of David and Goliath showed me that any challenge can be overcome when I place my trust in God’s guidance and strength. I would definitely be continuing to participate in small activities like this even If I am of a different denomination as long as it resonates with my beliefs and deepens my spiritual connections with God.
                                    <br><br>
	                                Because of this activity, I am reminded that I have to reinforce my belief of listening to God’s words during my life’s trials. This service became a meaningful experience, it reminded me of my faith and trust in God’s plan.

                                    Last October 20, I attended the Sunday Worship Celebration at Ikthus Robinsons. Before the service, I was participating in our LTS - Sunday School session, which was held at the same venue. After the session concluded, Ma’am Lor, our teacher, encouraged us to stay and listen to the sermon, which is how I found myself attending the worship celebration.
                                    <br><br>
	                                When I attended, they where already having their third session for their “Hope for the Underdog” series with speaker John Pausal. The series was centered around 1 Samuel 17:20-50. It was a really insightful sermon, The lesson was about how to find hope when you feel like the underdog. The truth is that we are never really prepared from the challenges of life, it is up to us whether we give up or accept defeat, or trust in God to give us strength. We must look back at the things that God has done for us and let this be the hope for the future. We must rely on God to give us strength because we must fight with faith and trust Him to fight for us. The lesson taught was that we have to always remain faithful despite being in hardships.
                                    <br><br>
	                                I do have to mention that I am from a different denomination but overall I’ve never heard or felt anything that was against my beliefs. This experience opened my eyes that religion really does not divide us, But our faiths unite us as one.I don’t intend to consistently participate in religious activities at Silliman, but I’m open to joining events that align with my beliefs.
                                    <br><br>
	                                Because of this activity, I am reminded that all of our challenges, our problems, our wars, should be given to God because our battles are His battles.

                                    Last October 25, I attended the last night of our evangelistic seminar titled “Happy Family Life Seminar”. This event was held at the outskirts of barangay Candau-ay and the speaker for this seminar is Mrs. Fe Pigon.
                                    <br><br>
	                                The seminar was all about having how to lead a happy family life. It all started with the commandment about honoring your mother and father. I’ve learned that leading a happy family begins with having respect, love, and understanding with each other.
                                    <br><br>
	                                This event was held near a squatter area, so naturally, many people from that community attended the seminar, as they were our target participants. Since my family was assigned to handle the food, I helped pack and distribute meals to the attendees. I can and would definitely join more evangelistic seminars connected to our pastors in the future.
                                    <br><br>
	                                Because of this seminar, I will aim to uphold my values. I’ve learned to always prioritize strengthening my relationship with my family to live a long and fruitful life.

                                    Last November 15, I joined a small group bible study together with my CCS friends. This bible study was headed by ate Kristine from IVCF Negros Oriental. This was held somewhere around the amphitheatre area.
                                    <br><br>
	                                In this bible study, we had an activity on making our personal shield, similar to the one we did in one of our PEP sessions. It was a reflective exercise on our strengths, values, who are the people we value, and how we see God. A great moment that happened here was that most of us had very similar faiths and beliefs. It was really great to know that even if I’m from a different religion, we still had the same directions with our faith.
                                    <br><br>
	                                In my opinion, engaging in these bible studies regularly should be something we all should really consider, because it lets us grow spiritually. I would definitely participate in another similar event. It is also a really great way to connect with others who share similar beliefs.
                                    <br><br>
	                                Because of this activity, I am inspired to strengthen my relationship with God. I realized that I did learn a lot of values from my belief in God and I hope that I can continue growing spiritually. This bible study reminded me to have a strong spiritual foundation and to live by prayer.

                                    Last November 16, I went with my friends to the Cathedral Church for the 44th Annual Fiesta Opening Salvo. This event was one of the first few events that starts of the fiesta of Dumaguete.
                                    <br><br>
	                                The message was about the history of the patron saint of Dumaguete. She was killed by a Roman emperor while trying to convert many people to Christianity. Even though she was offered pardon if she married him, she refused, saying her virginity and devotion were dedicated to Jesus Christ. Although I’m not Catholic, I still find it useful to know about the story of the patron saint of Dumaguete City.
                                    <br><br>
	                                To me, these church services are truly beneficial. Nowadays, many people, especially those from my generation, tend to stray away from God. However, I am not saying they are automatically bad because of this, but goodness is often associated with belief in and faith in God. While I may not continue joining religious events from the Catholic Church, this experience was still worth my time.
                                    <br><br>
	                                Because of this service, I always reminded of having good faith and devotion. This taught me to always be firm with my own beliefs even facing challenges. Although I may not continue participating in Catholic events, this experience has strengthened the value of having good spiritual health and reminded me of the power of dedication to one’s faith.
