                        <p class="contentDesc">Every semester, the Cultural Affairs Committee stages five shows that put value on the appreciation for the arts at what most consider as the “cultural center of the south”: the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium. Silliman students get a taste of the works of nationally- and internationally-acclaimed literary, visual and performing artists throughout the school year. Season tickets at subsidized rates are made available to students.</p>

                                    One of the first few university events that I’ve joined as a first year student, was this Freshie Walk. This event was really a great chance to meet with old friends and make new ones as well. But being a big introvert, I mostly just spoke with my old friends.
                                    <br><br>
	                                I never really expected that there are a lot of students in my department. I also got to see some old friends of mine from elementary school but sadly, some of them did not recognize me because of how much I’ve changed. Overall, I had a lot of fun walking around school and talking to people. One thing that bothered me though was the hot weather, because I was wearing a sweater.
                                    <br><br>
	                                I wish I could join this event again in the future but unfortunately I wouldn’t be a freshman anymore. This activity is important to have a good start for the school year. It was fun and honestly benefits me as I got to meet with old acquaintances.
                                    <br><br>
	                                Because of this activity, I was really excited to start this school year, not only as a computer science student, but as a Sillimanian. I’ll always be looking forward to meet new people. Hopefully, I could have a good experience in my time in this University.

                                    Last Wednesday, I watched the performance of the Tone-Key Quartet together with Marylou Alfafara and the Silliman and Don Bosco String Quartets at the Luce Auditorium. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Overall, the show was very fun and lively, and the quartet really showed their expertise with their respective instruments, But I think Mister Satoshi really got everyone’s attention during the entire show. In the show, the quartet played many classical pieces including Ritter Pasman by Strauss and Carmen Fantasy by Sarasate and some modern pieces. But the most entertaining pieces that they played are Syncopated Clock & Sandpaper and The Typewriter both by Leroy Anderson, Phantom of the Opera by Andrew Lloyd Weber, and their act of Anpanman. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    How they structured the program was amazing. During the first act, their intro was unexpected when they all went in one by one with different instruments with different beats and then transitioned to treasure island. It was a smart way of introducing the quartet instead of just walking in position and start playing. My favorite pieces where the Syncopated Clock & Sandpaper and the Typewriter because this pieces really showed that we really can make music anywhere in our lives, like how the constant beats of the typewriter would really make sense if it followed a certain rhythm. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Because of this performance, I gained a deeper appreciation for the creativity in music and how everyday sounds can be transformed into something musical. It also inspired me to explore different musical genres and experiment with sounds in new ways.

                                    Last Saturday, August, 24, I watched the show “Paghandom” at the Luce Auditorium. It is an annual show during Silliman’s cultural season and also celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Luce Auditorium. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The show had a lot to give. It was a long show with 2 parts and with different performances, it had dance performances, band performances, and voice performances. In the first act, my favorite performance was the play on Matchmaker. We had a little sneak peek of their performance during one of our music classes because they were practicing the song in our lecture room. I really liked the performance of the three singers, their tone quality was so spot on for the message of the song. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Overall, the show was very entertaining and enjoyable I was actually planning to leave in the middle of the second act, but the first few parts of the second act really got me hooked that I stayed till the end of the show. I could say that the singing groups, the choir, and all the other singers had a really spot on voice quality, each of the bands had their own unique style, and I could really say that it was quite an experience, as it was also my first time watching these types of shows. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Because of this wonderful performance, I learned that there are many talented folks in this school and learned the history of Silliman in the cultural aspect. As a musician, this show really inspires me to become a better performer. Their performances literally put me in awe and I could only wish that I could perform like them in the future.

                                    This event was hosted by the city during the Sandurot Festival last September. The event performers were the dancers from the Sidlakan Dance Company which is a local dance group that has achieved a lot internationally. 
                                    <br><br>
	                                The dance was about the culture of the Philippines. It showed the growth and change with culture through dance. What I’ve learned from this performance was that the Philippines is really diverse in culture but still we are united with dance. I also learned how dancing has a lot of purpose. Whether it would be for religious or rituals, to show masculinity, or just as a celebration.

	                                These types of performances could really benefit us through showing us our own culture so that we can learn its value and protect it. I would definitely watch these cultural dances in the next Sandurot Festival if given the chance. Though it was sad since the performance was ended abruptly because of the rain.

	                                Because of this performance I have gained a greater appreciation for my own culture. I learned that dance can convey such powerful stories and traditions and that we should take care of our history and preserve our heritage for future generations.

                                    The Hari at Reyna ng Sandurot event happened on September 25. This event was part of the multiple activities made by the city government. Participants in this event where from public schools that where under the city’s provision.
                                    <br><br>
	                                I watched this event because my high school, Dumaguete Science High School, was one of the contingents of this pageant. Each school had stunning and smart contestants and that established my initial thoughts of them. During the segment with different outfits, to me all of them where stunning. 
                                    <br><br>
	                                What I was really waiting for, was the question-and-answer portion. Although there were contestants that stuttered and sometimes had a hard time with their thoughts, their answers still had good points. But my favorite has got to be from my high school’s Reyna since her answer was short and straight to the point, or you could say I am really biased about it. I can’t wait to root for my high school again for next year’s Hari at Reyna ng Sandurot.
                                    <br><br>
	                                Because of this event, I am proud that my high school nailed the competition. It was also a nice addition to the Sandurot Festival since this was the very first Sandurot Pageant.

                                    Last September 28, my department had our acquaintance party. This event was hosted by the Confederates Student Council and held on the Silliman University Elementary Grounds.
                                    <br><br> 
	                                This event was incredibly fun with all the games and activities we had. I met a lot of new people in this party, some of them even became a close friends to me. 
                                    <br><br>
	                                To me, this party is important to attend to because this is a chance to meet new friends and build connections within the department. It is important to make friends in college since we are all in this same boat and we should learn to connect with others.
                                    <br><br>
	                                Because of this event, I am grateful since I got to meet friends. All I could say is that this party was super fun because we also had fun games and most importantly the opportunity to interact with others.
